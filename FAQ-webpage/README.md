# FAQ Page

This project is a simple FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page. It provides users with information on how to track an order and the return policy. The page is built using HTML for structure and content, and CSS for styling.

## Overview

The page is structured into the following main sections:

* **Header:** Contains the main heading "Frequently Asked Questions" and a brief description.
* **Main:** Contains the FAQ content, with sections for "How can I track my order?" and "What is your return policy?".

## HTML Structure

The HTML structure uses semantic HTML5 elements to organize the content:

* `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type.
* `<head>`: Contains metadata, including character set, viewport settings for responsiveness, linked Google Fonts, stylesheet link, and title.
* `<body>`: Contains the visible page content.
* `<header>`: Defines the header section with the main heading (`<h1>`) and a paragraph (`<p>`).
* `<main>`: Contains the main content of the page.
* `<div>` elements with class `center-items`: Used to structure the content within the main section.
* `<h2>`: Used for the FAQ questions.
* `<p>`: Used for the answers to the FAQ questions.
* `<ol>`: Used for ordered lists (order tracking steps).
* `<ul>`: Used for unordered lists (return policy information).
* `<a>`: Used for links.
* `<hr>`: Used to create a horizontal line to separate the FAQ sections.

## CSS Styling

The `style.css` file handles the visual presentation of the FAQ page. Key aspects of the styling include:

* **Global Styles:**
    * `html` and `body` styles define margin, padding, font family, font size, text color, and background color.
* **Header Styling:**
    * Background color, display (block), margin, text alignment, and padding are defined for the header.
    * Font sizes and font weight are defined for the heading (`h1`) and subheading (`p`).
* **Main Styling:**
    * Background color, display (flex), flex direction, alignment, justification, and padding are defined for the main section.
* `.center-items` Styling:
    * Display (flex), flex direction, alignment, justification, flex grow, and width are defined for the `center-items` class.
* `hr` Styling:
    * Width, border, and margin are defined for the horizontal rule.
* `a` Styling:
    * Text decoration and color are defined for links, including hover effects.
* **Media Query:**
    * A media query (`@media (max-width: 700px)`) adjusts the padding of the `main` section and the width of the horizontal rule and `center-items` for smaller screens to maintain responsiveness.

## File Structure

* `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the FAQ page.
* `style.css`: The CSS file containing the styles for the FAQ page.

## How to Run the Project

1.  Clone the repository or download the files.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Potential Improvements

* **Accessibility:**
    * Ensure that the links are descriptive and accessible to screen readers.
    * Consider using ARIA attributes for more complex interactive elements (if any were to be added).
* **Enhanced Responsiveness:**
    * While there is a media query, more comprehensive testing and adjustments for various screen sizes could enhance the responsiveness.
* **Modularity:**
    * For a more extensive FAQ, consider a more modular approach, perhaps using JavaScript to dynamically show/hide answers, which would improve user experience.

## Code Evaluation

**Strengths:**

* **HTML Structure:**
    * Semantic HTML elements are used appropriately, contributing to a clear and organized structure.
* **CSS Styling:**
    * The styling is well-organized and readable.
    * Flexbox is used effectively for layout.
    * A media query is included for basic responsiveness.
* **Readability:**
    * The code is generally easy to read and understand due to consistent indentation and clear naming conventions.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Interactivity:**
    * The current FAQ page is static. Adding interactivity (e.g., expanding/collapsing answers) would significantly improve the user experience.
* **Responsiveness:**
    * While a media query is present, more thorough testing and adjustments for various screen sizes would be beneficial.
* **Accessibility:**
    * A more in-depth accessibility review would be beneficial, especially if interactive elements are added.
