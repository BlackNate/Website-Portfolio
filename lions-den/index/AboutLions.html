                    <h2>The Glorious Mane: A Symbol of Dominance</h2>
                    <p>Perhaps the most recognizable feature of a male lion is its mane. This thick, luxurious growth of hair around the head and neck serves several crucial purposes:</p>
                    <div class="split-section">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Visual Dominance:</strong> A larger, darker mane signifies a male's age, health, and genetic fitness.Females are more attracted to males with impressive manes, as it indicates a strong provider and protector.</li>
                            <li><strong>Protection:</strong> The mane acts as a shield during fights, protecting the vulnerable neck area from bites and scratches.</li>
                            <li><strong>Temperature Regulation:</strong> While it may seem counterintuitive, the mane can also play a role in regulating body temperature, providing insulation in cooler climates and potentially offering some shade in intense heat.</li>
                            <li><strong>Variation:</strong> Mane color ranges from blonde to black, with darker manes generally indicating older, more dominant males. The size and density of the mane also vary depending on genetics, age, and environmental factors.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>Size and Build: A Powerful Physique</h2>
                    <p>Lions are the second-largest cats in the world, after tigers. Their muscular build is perfectly adapted for hunting and fighting:</p>
                    <div class="split-section">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Male Size:</strong> Adult male lions typically weigh between 330 and 550 pounds (150-250 kg) and measure around 8 to 10 feet (2.5-3 meters) in length, including their tail.</li>
                            <li><strong>Female Size:</strong> Females are smaller, weighing between 265 and 400 pounds (120-182 kg) and measuring approximately 7 to 9 feet (2.1-2.7 meters) in length.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><strong>Powerful Legs:</strong> Their strong legs allow for bursts of speed and powerful leaps, essential for taking down large prey.</li>
                            <li><strong>Retractable Claws:</strong> Like all cats, lions have retractable claws, which are kept sharp and hidden when not in use. These claws are crucial for gripping and holding onto prey.</li>
                            <li><strong>Powerful Jaws and Teeth: </strong> Their jaws are incredibly powerful, equipped with large canine teeth for delivering killing bites.</li>
